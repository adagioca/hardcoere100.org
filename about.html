    <p>The group start is planned for 6:30am, from the Hunting Hollow entrance. It will be <strong>hot</strong> out there on Saturday (expect a high temperature in the mid-90F), and it will get hot fast (friday night winds are forecast to come from the north east) - please hydrate and be careful out there.</p>
    
    <p>A positive side effect is that conditions will be great for night riding!</p>
    
    <p>The 100 mile and 100 km route remain unchanged. Expect things to be quite dry out there; the trails should be in fairly good shape, not too many trees down and the 'overgrown' factor seems to be moderate (relatively).</p>

	<p class="pheader">About</p>

<p>The Hard COEre 100 is an unofficial 100 mile mountain bike challenge taking place in <a href="http://www.coepark.org/">Henry Coe State Park</a> near Gilroy, California. 
This is not an organized race or sanctioned event - <b>there is no entry fee, no prizes, no support</b>. It is similar in format and spirit to events such as the <a href="http://topofusion.com/azt/race.php">AZTR 300/750</a> and other self-supported events.

<p>All that is provided is a route, a suggested start time and tabulation of "results". There is no race organization, no checkpoints, no support system - you are completely on your own. The <a href="description.html">route description page</a> contains a few tips with regards to logistics (water etc) and timing (the aim is to finish in one day).</p>
<p>
You're welcome to ride the route at any time. We* provide a suggested start date if you want others to ride with/against. ITTs (individual time trials) will be ranked with the current year's results. If you want to be included in the results you need to adhere to the <a href="http://coepark.net/pineridgeassociation/activities/mountain-biking">park's regulations</a> and some basic rules of self-supported travel (such as <a href="http://www.topofusion.com/azt/race-rules.php">listed here</a>). It is your responsibility to know, understand and follow these rules. We'll observe the honor system (i.e. we'll take you on your word with regards to traveled route, finishing time and such unless we have good reason not to - of course you're more than welcome to send us or post a recorded gpx file). Please <a href="mailto:bsteed@hardcoere100.org">contact us here</a> if you have questions or comments. 

<p class="footnoteremark">(*) In case you're wondering: 'we' are a bunch of Coe nuts (Dirk/ElHombre, Patrick/Ratpick and Roy/Plymmer) <!-- who in a hopefully temporary bout of insanity have planned to line up for this on Saturday 10/16/10, 2am.--> </p>
</p>
<p>
There are no rewards for completing this, except for the immense sense of accomplishment you should feel, the fact that you've been able to enjoy the glorious beauty of this vast and underappreciated land and the infinite fame and bragging rights granted to you by having your name listed on this site!

The experienced endurance mountain biker may not be too impressed by the prospect of doing a 100-miler, but this is not an ordinary 100-miler. For starters, it consists of one big loop, with no laps or repeats, most of it in a remote near-wilderness hours away from civilization. It also features over 20,000 foot of total elevation gain (or, about 25% more than the hardest NUE 100 mile races), on terrain and in conditions that can be brutal and unforgiving. The majority of trails in Coe weren't 'designed' or built with mountain biking in mind; they often consist of half-overgrown game trails, rocky creek beds, ridiculously steep fireroads and old horse carriage trails. But there's also plenty of buff and gorgeous singletrack to be found.</p>

<p>Finally, if you're a local, we'd encourage you to support the volunteer <a href="http://www.coepark.org/trailwork.html">trail work</a>, more info on trail work days and Coe rides in general can be found on <a href="http://forums.mtbr.com/forumdisplay.php?f=67">the Norcal forum</a> of mtbr.com (a quick search on 'Henry Coe' will yield a wealth of information). </p>
