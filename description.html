    <p class="footnoteremark"></p>
   
    <p>Advice: don't think about attempting this unless you are able to navigate on your own (using maps, GPS or memory) and get out of Coe by yourself if needed. It is not a good place to take wrong turns, get lost or rely on others for your well-being.</p>
    <p> The <a href="routeoption1.html">cue sheet</a> contains detailed directions and the mileages for all segments of the route; below is an elevation profile:</p>
    
    <img alt="scene from Hard COEre 100" src="images/HC100Elevation.jpg"><br/><br/>
    <p class="pheader">Route highlights</p>
    <p>The route can be thought of to consist of 4 legs: 1) Hunting Hollow (HH) to Headquarters (HQ), 2) HQ to Pacheco Camp (PC), 3) PC past Dowdy Ranch (DR) to the top of Wagon road, and 4) Wagon back to HH.</p>
    <p>Regarding logistics: both HQ and DR have potable water (no need for filtering), HQ has a coffee and vending machine (accessible during office hours), PC has a reliable source of water but needs filtering or chemical treatment, and there are many small ponds and lakes along the way with varying degrees of water quality and level that can be used to source water for filtering.</p>
    <p>Coe hazards (or highlights, depending how you look at it) include mountain lions, rattlesnakes, wild boar, deer, ticks, poison oak, sharp snagging branches and other overgrowth, and of course: brutally steep trails.</p>
    <p>Click below for more detail on the various parts of the route:</p>

    <p><a href="JavaScript:doMenu('main1');" id=xmain1>[+]</a> Leg 1: HH to HQ (36 miles)
	<div id=main1 style="margin-left:1em; display: none">

    <p>A lot of slow, hard stuff (the Lyman-Willson climb, the Cross Canyon climb(s), the Mahoney Meadows wall to Lost Spring) is served up front. Some of the more technical descents such as Timm* and the traverse of Cross Canyon should provide a good challenge. Cross Canyon, Willow Ridge trail and China Hole offer awesome and fast descents.</p>
    <p class="footnoteremark">(*) Sadly, in early 2012 Timm trail has been somewhat 'neutered', but it remains a fun and flowy descent.</p></div></p>
    
    <p><a href="JavaScript:doMenu('main2');" id=xmain2>[+]</a> Leg 2: HQ to PC (24 miles)
	<div id=main2 style="margin-left:1em; display: none">
	<p> This part combines one of the best and longest descents of the day (Middle Ridge) with arguably the most grueling climb (Bear Mountain). After scaling Bear Mountain, the route drops the riders to Mississippi Lake (another good source of water - requiring filtering); subsequently, at times primitive trails (Heritage, upper Pacheco Creek trail) lead back southwards to Pacheco Camp.</p>
    </p></div></p>
    
    <p><a href="JavaScript:doMenu('main3');" id=xmain3>[+]</a> Leg 3: PC to top Wagon (20 miles)
	<div id=main3 style="margin-left:1em; display: none">
	<p>Probably the make-it or break-it part. It features a deep dive into the Coe backcountry, with as main highlight undoubtedly Dutch's trail: a truly great descent, with some short but stinging climbs mixed in. Near North Fork trail one ends up at the lowest point of the entire route (in elevation, possibly also in morale), leaving a brutal, no-prisoners-taken climb out to Dowdy Ranch and beyond. Burra Burra trail provides some fun singletrack, and a break from the climbing action, but Center (non-)Flats road has a tendency to squeeze all remaining energy out of ones legs.</p>
    </p></div></p>
     
    <p><a href="JavaScript:doMenu('main4');" id=xmain4>[+]</a> Leg 4: Wagon to HH (20 miles)
	<div id=main4 style="margin-left:1em; display: none">
    <p>The 'easy' leg, and something to look forward to during the butchery of the preceding miles: it features mostly gradual (for Coe standards) fireroad climbs, and highly entertaining, fun singletrack descents (Kelly Lake trail, Dexter trail), with a long descent home on Wagon road. Oh yes, but with a 500ft tall twist at the end.</p>  
    
    </p></div></p>
    
       <p class="pheader">Why this time of the year?</p>
    <p>A tradeoff: in spring, there may be a lot of water running through the various creeks and otherwise easy trail sections or creekbeds may become serious barriers - at the least they'll slow you down quite a bit. Also, trails tend to get overgrown, poison oak (everyones favorite weed) can be rampant and there's an army of ticks out. But there is often also a great wildflower show. Dry periods during the winter would work but the days are short. In summer it gets brutally hot. So fall seems to be a good compromise.</p>
    
    <p class="pheader">How long will it take me?</p>
    <p>Coe tends to slow one down - too many bumpy and steep trails, wildlife running in the way, assorted hazards and nice photo opportunities. Fast experienced riders should count on 15-16 hours (self-supported). Check the recaps for more insight - it may take over 20 hours. You may be a lot faster though, only one way to find out!</p>

    <p><u>Update 2012/10/7</u>: 
    <ul>
    
    <li class="smallfontli"> Quick result update: I'm happy to report that we had seven 100 mile finishers (Brian, Sean, Brett, Erik, Patrick, Roy and Dirk), and two 100k finishers (Mei and Charlie) - congrats to all, and special kudos to Mei for making an awesome 'finishers' noodle soup and to Charlie for knocking out an enormous ride after some mechanical troubles.

Brian put down a blistering pace, finishing in 15 hours and change, demolishing the course record, about 45 min to an hour ahead of Sean (more later, when the GPS units have spit out their data).

It seems everyone is accounted for and made it safely back out of Coe. It was a great day out there. More later, first sleep...</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
   
    <p><u>Update 2012/10/4</u>: 
    <ul>
    
    <li class="smallfontli">With an evil sense of timing, the MTBGuru.com server has just succumbed; the cause of death is 'unrecoverable hardware failure'; no links to MTBGuru trip sites will currently work. The data is safe (backed up) but it will likely take some time to get it running on a new server (several days or more). I've made sure all relevant GPX files are hosted on this site (on a different server) and I inserted below a jpg version of the course map - but send me an <a href="mailto:bsteed@hardcoere100.org">email</a> if something is unclear or missing.</li>
       
    <li class="smallfontli">There were some fixes done to the 100k GPX file. Please re-download and update it if you plan to use it (links and filename are the same). Also, it was pointed out that last year's recorded 100 miler GPX file on the MTBGuru trip page contains some (GPS) glitches. Do NOT use that file - the GPX file that is linked on this site is and has always been the correct, glitch-free version, so there shouldn't be a problem if you've been using that one (btw, I updated the first paragraph above to reflect this - sorry for any confusion this may have caused). Also, consider this a plug for carrying a paper map and/or cue sheet as backup.</li>
    
    <li class="smallfontli">The weather forecast for Saturday looks even better than hoped for: partly sunny, with low 52F and high 75F. This was quite different the last couple weekends, with temperatures soaring into the 90's. Aaron and Garret's attempt was unfortunately foiled by these hellish conditions - they took a bee line home around mile 80 - Aaron may chime in later with a recap of their ride.</li>  
    <li class="smallfontli">There are reports of many trees down along the course - not on very hazardous spots, but please be on the lookout and be careful on blind corners etc (which you always need to be anyway)...
    </li>
    <li class="smallfontli">Saturday is approaching quickly - we plan to start at 7am sharp, to make use of all the available daylight (no lights will be needed in the morning), and will do a quick rider briefing around 6.45am - in particular if you've never been to Coe, please show up early...</li>
    </ul>
	</p>
    
    <p><u>Update 2012/09/21</u>: 
    <ul>
    <li class="smallfontli">Aaron ('veteran' from 2011) and his buddy Garret are planning to go for it tomorrow (9/22). They couldn't make the October 6th start and are giving it a shot this weekend - we're stoked for them and wish them the best of luck!</li>
    <li class="smallfontli">For those entertaining the Everest Challenge, riding <a href="http://www.mtbguru.com/trip/show/138462-coe-everest-bonus-loop">this extra loop</a> twice (after completing the 100 mile course) should roughly get you those 9,000 extra vertical feet needed (<a href="EverestBonusLoop.gpx">GPX file</a>). 
    </li>
    <li class="smallfontli">There seems to be a nice group of people shaping up interested in the metric (100 km) course. Metric course info will be <a href="descriptionmetric.html">collected here</a> - there's e.g. a short hand route notation and embedded map; a cue sheet is upcoming.
    </li>
    </ul>
	</p>
    
    <p><u>Update 2012/09/03</u>: 
    <ul>
    <li class="smallfontli">The 2012 route is identical to the 2011 version. As last year, the ride coincides with the <a href="http://coepark.net/pineridgeassociation/component/eventlist/details/7-tarantula-barbeque">Tarantula festival</a>, taking place at Coe Headquarters, where most riders are expected to arrive around noon or later - it's useful to know that (BBQ) meals can be purchased there until 2pm (no pre-ordering this time, it's first come, first serve).
    </li>
    <li class="smallfontli">A novelty this year is a <a href="http://www.mtbguru.com/trip/show/138331-hard-coere-100-metric-course-100-km">100 km route</a> as (slightly easier) alternative - a metric century. Still a brutal test for any rider (14,000 ft of climbing), and it coincides largely with the 100 miler (leg 3 is cut off, and some other shortcuts are taken). Here is the <a href="http://www.mtbguru.com/trip/gpx_file/138331.gpx">GPX file</a>. Fast riders will probably be able to knock this off without having to nightride. More info later, if it turns out there's interest in this.
    </li>
    <li class="smallfontli">Check out the archived route updates of 2011 (below) - a lot of the things mentioned there are still relevant. In the next few weeks some recon rides are planned and more trail status info will be posted when available.
    </li>
    <li class="smallfontli">Regarding the <a href="http://savecoepark.org">Everest Challenge</a>: this challenge is still unmet, and for good reason: climbing 29,029 feet in Coe on a single ride (preferably in under 24 hours) is ridiculously hard. So ridiculous, that some may be tempted to go for it (in the end, after the 100 miler one has already climbed +20k feet). Obviously, anyone who would able to pull this off will receive endless accolades and praise on this site, so please have a go for it if you do feel called upon (note: as there are many route options to gain the final 9k feet, feel free to improvize - make sure you have sufficient battery power for your GPS to record and document things).</li>
    <li class="smallfontli">Finally: it is not necessary, but please <a href="mailto:bsteed@hardcoere100.org">email me</a> (Bob Steed) if you plan to show up (and specify if you want to attempt the 100 miler, the 100 k or Everest) - so I can keep you posted on late minute updates etc by email.</li>

    <p><u>Update 2011/09/25</u>: an update on the conditions out there after some recon rides the last few weeks:
    <ul>
    <li class="smallfontli">Unlike our ride last year (which took place mid-November), the trails are bone-dry. It hasn't rained here in over three months and you should expect loose, slippery conditions, and poor traction on many descents, so be careful.</li>
    <li class="smallfontli">There are several late-season downed trees on the course (e.g. on the descent into Cross Canyon), so again, be prepared and careful.</li>
    <li class="smallfontli">It may be hot out there - there is water available in the locations mentioned below, and in addition it can also be filtered from e.g. Mississippi Lake (~mile 50), Coit Lake (~mile 83) and probably Camp Willson (~mile 91). Also, it is very easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the park - if that's the case make sure to carry a good map and/or a GPS, with enough battery power to last a very long time. Again (you know the drill), be careful, heat stroke is no joke. Cellphone reception in Henry Coe park is generally intermittent (varies from having a strong signal on some ridges and peaks, to nothing in the canyons).</li>
    <li class="smallfontli">There was an army of gnats and flies out there the last weeks which can be very annoying during breaks or slow climbs; consider bringing some deterrant (e.g. Deet spray). Also, don't bring socks or leg warmers you're emotionally attached to - they will be covered in resilient little burrs. There is also a lot of poison oak near or on some trails - right now the 'evil weed' is fairly easy to spot as it often has turned bright red. It probably does not need mention, but stay away from it if you're sensitive to it.</li>
    <li class="smallfontli">Bike choice: hardtails will do ok on the terrain though there will be some bumpy sections and descents where you'll be dreaming of full suspension. A light full suspension bike is probably ideal. Singlespeeders should expect to walk many climbs (20% grades are very common), unless you have a very small gear. Tires: remember the loose conditions. Goatheads (puncturevine) and their ilk are very rare in Coe, though yesterday one of my riding partners suffered a flat from one.
    </li>
     <li class="smallfontli">Bowl trail (at the very beginning of the course) now has a new bypass section around the pond with the washout. You can either stay on the old trail (which is recorded in the GPX-file) and walk around the washout, or ride the new bypass (recommended). The bypass splits off to the left side of the old trail and runs above the pond.
     </li>
    <li class="smallfontli">By sheer coincidence, the <a href="http://www.coepark.org/tfest.html">Tarantula Festival</a> takes place on October 1st at Coe Headquarters. You could buy food tickets ahead of time to get food from their BBQ and refuel - expect there may be a crowd (and line) though. The riders hit HQ at around mile 35. Food will be served there starting at 11.30am.
    </li>

    <p><u>Update 2011/09/21</u>: </p>

    <p class="updatepar">A small modification to the course has been made (see image below): Phoneline trail has been added, bypassing an uninspiring section of Coit Road. This is thanks to the tireless efforts of Charlie (also known as Skyline35) and Greg (lokoyokel) who made resurrecting this trail in its former glory (it's a fun singletrack descent) one of their projects this year. The new route is <a href="http://www.hardcoere100.org/HC100FinalWithPhoneline.gpx"> available here as GPX file</a>. Note, due to the last minute nature of this change and the fact that it's a pretty minor one in the grand scheme, last year's route (<a href="http://californication.mtbguru.com/files/HC100FinalRecorded.gpx">2010 GPX file</a>, as downloaded from my Garmin Edge 705) will be accepted as well.
